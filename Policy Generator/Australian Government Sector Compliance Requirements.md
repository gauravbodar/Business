# Australian Government Sector Compliance Requirements

The Australian Government sector operates under a highly regulated environment with strict requirements for protective security and information management. Compliance is mandatory for all Commonwealth entities and is primarily driven by the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and the Information Security Manual (ISM), complemented by the Essential Eight and, in some cases, ISO 27001.

## Key Compliance Frameworks and Standards:

1.  **PSPF (Protective Security Policy Framework):**
    *   **Purpose:** The PSPF is a mandatory policy framework for all non-corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). It sets out the government's requirements for protecting its people, information, and assets, both domestically and overseas. It also provides better practice guidance for corporate Commonwealth entities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies.
    *   **Key Requirements:** The PSPF is structured around 16 policies across four security domains:
        *   **Security Governance:** Policies related to security planning, risk management, and security culture.
        *   **Information Security:** Policies covering the classification, handling, storage, and disposal of official information.
        *   **Personnel Security:** Policies for screening personnel, managing security clearances, and fostering a security-conscious workforce.
        *   **Physical Security:** Policies for protecting government assets and facilities from unauthorized access.
    *   **Mandatory Compliance:** Entities must comply with the PSPF, and compliance is regularly assessed. Recent updates (e.g., PSPF 2025) mandate the adoption of Zero Trust principles and enhanced Insider Risk Management.

2.  **ISM (Information Security Manual):**
    *   **Purpose:** The ISM, published by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), provides a cyber security framework that Australian Government organisations can apply to protect their information and systems from cyber threats. It details a comprehensive set of controls and guidelines for securing information and communication technology (ICT) systems.
    *   **Key Requirements:** The ISM covers a vast array of cybersecurity topics, including:
        *   **Cybersecurity Governance:** Establishing a robust cybersecurity posture.
        *   **Personnel Security:** Managing personnel access and responsibilities.
        *   **Physical Security:** Protecting ICT equipment and facilities.
        *   **Information Security:** Classifying, handling, and storing information.
        *   **System Hardening:** Implementing secure configurations for operating systems, applications, and networks.
        *   **Incident Response:** Developing capabilities to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents.
        *   **Cryptography:** Guidance on using cryptographic controls to protect data.
    *   **Relationship with PSPF:** The ISM provides the detailed technical and procedural controls necessary to implement the information security policies outlined in the PSPF.

3.  **Essential Eight:**
    *   **Purpose:** The Essential Eight mitigation strategies, also from the ACSC, are a prioritized set of practical controls designed to help organisations mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various threats. They are a subset of the broader ISM controls.
    *   **Key Requirements:** The Essential Eight focuses on eight key strategies:
        *   Application whitelisting
        *   Patch applications
        *   Configure Microsoft Office macro settings
        *   Harden user applications
        *   Restrict administrative privileges
        *   Patch operating systems
        *   Multi-factor authentication
        *   Daily backups
    *   **Mandatory for some entities:** While generally recommended, the Essential Eight is mandatory for some government entities, and many aim to achieve higher maturity levels. It is often seen as a baseline for good cyber hygiene.

4.  **ISO 27001:**
    *   **Relevance:** While not mandatory for all Australian Government entities, ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System) certification is often pursued by government agencies or their vendors to demonstrate adherence to internationally recognized information security best practices. It provides a structured approach to managing information security risks and can complement the ISM and PSPF by providing a management framework.

## Overlaps and Synergies:

For Australian Government entities, the PSPF and ISM are the primary and mandatory frameworks. The ISM provides the 'how-to' for the information security aspects of the PSPF. The Essential Eight offers a focused set of technical controls that contribute directly to both ISM and PSPF compliance. ISO 27001 can provide an overarching management system that helps integrate and manage compliance with these Australian-specific requirements.

## Controls for Policy Generation:

When generating policies for the Australian Government sector, the AI engine must consider:

*   **PSPF Policy Requirements:** Policies must directly address the 16 policies and their associated requirements, covering security governance, information, personnel, and physical security.
*   **ISM Controls:** Incorporate specific ISM controls relevant to the policy area, detailing technical and procedural security measures.
*   **Essential Eight Maturity:** Policies should reflect the required or desired maturity level of Essential Eight implementation.
*   **Information Classification:** Policies must align with the Australian Government's information classification scheme (e.g., PROTECTED, SECRET, TOP SECRET).
*   **Personnel Security:** Policies for security clearances, background checks, and ongoing personnel security obligations.
*   **Third-Party Vendor Requirements:** Policies for managing security risks when engaging with external service providers, ensuring they meet government security standards.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Clear policies for reporting security incidents to relevant authorities (e.g., ACSC, ASD).
*   **Audit and Assurance:** Policies detailing internal and external audit requirements to demonstrate compliance.
