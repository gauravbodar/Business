# Data & Compliance Layer Architecture

The Data & Compliance Layer is the foundational component responsible for managing all compliance-related data, including regulatory frameworks, client-specific policies, audit trails, and evidence of compliance. This layer is designed to ensure data integrity, security, and auditability, which are paramount in a compliance automation platform.

## 1. Data Models for Compliance Frameworks

To effectively manage and automate compliance, a robust and flexible data model is required to represent various compliance frameworks (ISM, Essential 8, ISO 27001) and their interrelationships. The data model will be designed to accommodate current and future standards, allowing for easy expansion and integration.

**Core Entities and Relationships:**

*   **Framework:** Represents a compliance standard (e.g., ISM, Essential 8, ISO 27001).
    *   Attributes: `FrameworkID`, `Name`, `Version`, `Description`, `IssuingBody`.
*   **Control:** A specific requirement or guideline within a framework.
    *   Attributes: `ControlID`, `FrameworkID (FK)`, `ControlNumber`, `Title`, `Description`, `MaturityLevel (for Essential 8)`, `Category`.
*   **Guidance/Requirement:** Detailed explanation or specific actions required for a control.
    *   Attributes: `GuidanceID`, `ControlID (FK)`, `Text`, `ReferenceURL`.
*   **Mapping:** Links controls across different frameworks to identify commonalities and streamline compliance efforts.
    *   Attributes: `MappingID`, `ControlID_A (FK)`, `ControlID_B (FK)`, `RelationshipType` (e.g., 


 'maps_to', 'part_of').

**Detailed Data Model Considerations:**

*   **Frameworks (ISM, Essential 8, ISO 27001):** Each framework will have a top-level entity. For instance, the ISM might have hierarchical controls, while Essential 8 focuses on maturity levels for its eight strategies. ISO 27001 will have its Annex A controls.
*   **Controls:** Each control will be uniquely identified and linked back to its parent framework. Attributes will capture the control's specific text, its purpose, and any associated guidance. For Essential 8, the maturity level (0-3) for each control will be a critical attribute.
*   **Cross-Framework Mapping:** A crucial aspect will be the ability to map controls between different frameworks. For example, an ISM control related to access management might map to an ISO 27001 control on access control and an Essential 8 strategy for restricting administrative privileges. This mapping will enable clients to see how their efforts contribute to multiple compliance goals simultaneously.
*   **Version Control:** All framework data, controls, and guidance will be version-controlled to track changes over time, ensuring that policies generated are based on the most current standards.

**Technology Choice:**

For storing this structured, relational data, **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service) with a PostgreSQL or MySQL engine is a strong candidate. It offers managed database services, ensuring high availability, backups, and scalability. Alternatively, **Amazon Aurora** could be used for higher performance and compatibility with MySQL/PostgreSQL. For metadata and less structured data, **Amazon DynamoDB** could be considered.

## 2. Data Storage Solutions for Policies and Audit Trails

This section details how client-specific policies, generated documents, and critical audit trails will be stored, ensuring both accessibility and long-term retention.

**2.1. Client-Specific Policies and Generated Documents:**

*   **Storage:** All generated policies, tender responses, and other client-specific documents will be stored in **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**. S3 provides highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage, ideal for unstructured data like documents.
*   **Metadata:** Alongside the documents in S3, metadata (e.g., `ClientID`, `DocumentType`, `FrameworkID`, `Version`, `GenerationDate`, `ApprovalStatus`, `AssociatedControls`) will be stored in a relational database (RDS/Aurora) or a NoSQL database (DynamoDB) to facilitate searching, filtering, and linking documents to specific compliance contexts.
*   **Version Control:** S3's native versioning capabilities will be enabled for document buckets to maintain a history of all policy changes, crucial for auditability.
*   **Encryption:** All data in S3 will be encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and in transit using SSL/TLS.

**2.2. Audit Trails and Evidence of Compliance:**

*   **Audit Logs:** Detailed logs of all system activities, including AI agent actions, human-in-the-loop approvals, data access, and modifications, will be captured. These logs are critical for demonstrating compliance and investigating incidents.
    *   **AWS CloudTrail:** Will record all API calls made to AWS services, providing a comprehensive audit trail of actions taken within the AWS environment.
    *   **Amazon CloudWatch Logs:** Will collect application logs from N8N workflows, Lambda functions, and other services, providing insights into operational activities.
*   **Compliance Evidence:** Any evidence collected or generated to demonstrate compliance (e.g., system configurations, scan results, user access reviews) will also be stored in S3, linked to relevant controls and policies via metadata in the database.
*   **Immutable Storage:** For critical audit trails and evidence, S3 Object Lock can be utilized to create WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage, preventing accidental or malicious deletion or modification for a specified retention period.

**Technology Choices:**

*   **Amazon S3:** For scalable, secure, and durable storage of documents and compliance evidence.
*   **Amazon RDS/Aurora or DynamoDB:** For storing metadata associated with documents and for managing structured audit records.
*   **AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch Logs:** For comprehensive logging and monitoring of system activities.

## 3. Ensuring Data Integrity and Auditability Mechanisms

Data integrity and auditability are non-negotiable requirements for a compliance platform. Several mechanisms will be put in place to guarantee these aspects.

*   **Referential Integrity:** Enforced in relational databases (RDS/Aurora) to ensure consistency between related data entities (e.g., a policy must always link to an existing client and framework).
*   **Data Validation:** Input validation at the application layer (e.g., within N8N workflows, Lambda functions) to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints before storage.
*   **Access Control:** Strict implementation of **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** policies to control who can access, modify, or delete data. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied across all data stores.
*   **Encryption:** All data will be encrypted at rest (using KMS) and in transit (using SSL/TLS) to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   **Hashing and Digital Signatures:** For critical documents and audit logs, cryptographic hashing can be used to detect tampering. Digital signatures can be applied to generated policies to verify their authenticity and integrity.
*   **Immutable Logs:** As mentioned, S3 Object Lock can provide immutable storage for audit logs, ensuring that historical records cannot be altered.
*   **Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery:** Automated backups for databases (RDS) and versioning for S3 buckets will ensure data recoverability. A comprehensive disaster recovery plan will be in place to minimize data loss and downtime.
*   **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging via CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs, combined with application-level logging within N8N workflows, will provide a complete, chronological record of all activities, enabling full auditability.
*   **Data Retention Policies:** Clearly defined data retention policies will be implemented and enforced to comply with regulatory requirements for data archiving and deletion.

By implementing these measures, the Data & Compliance Layer will provide a trustworthy and verifiable foundation for all compliance activities, supporting the platform's claims of audit-readiness and data integrity.
