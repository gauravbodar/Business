## Detailed AI Policy Generation Prompts

Building upon the Core AI Agent Layer, the effectiveness of the Policy Generator Agent hinges on the quality and specificity of the prompts provided to the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs). This section details the strategy for constructing robust AI prompts that enable the generation of accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant compliance policies. The prompts are designed to guide the AI towards producing policies that adhere to specific compliance frameworks, Australian industry requirements, and organizational profiles, as identified in the expanded research phase.

### Principles of Effective AI Policy Generation Prompts

Effective prompts are the cornerstone of high-quality AI-driven policy generation. They must be meticulously crafted to direct the AI model towards desired outcomes while minimizing ambiguity and ensuring compliance. The following principles underpin the design of these prompts:

1.  **Specificity and Clarity:** Each prompt must clearly define the policy's scope, purpose, and target audience. Ambiguous language is avoided to prevent misinterpretation by the AI.
2.  **Contextual Richness:** Prompts incorporate detailed organizational context, including the industry sector, operational environment, existing technology stack, and types of data handled. This contextual information allows the AI to tailor policies to the client's unique circumstances.
3.  **Explicit Framework Alignment:** The prompt explicitly names the compliance framework(s) (e.g., ISM, Essential 8, ISO 27001, PSPF, APRA CPS 234, Privacy Act 1988) and specifies the exact controls, clauses, or principles the policy must address. For frameworks with maturity models (like Essential 8), the target maturity level is specified.
4.  **Desired Output Format and Tone:** The prompt dictates the expected output format (e.g., Markdown with hierarchical headings, bullet points) and the required tone (e.g., formal, authoritative, technical, accessible). This ensures consistency and readability.
5.  **Constraint Definition:** Any limitations or exclusions are clearly stated, such as avoiding specific technical configurations, adhering to word counts, or focusing on policy principles rather than implementation details.
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** The process of prompt engineering is recognized as iterative. Initial prompts are tested, and the AI's output is reviewed by human experts. Feedback is then used to refine the prompts, improving the accuracy and relevance of subsequent policy generations.

### General Prompt Structure for Policy Generation

To ensure consistency and comprehensive coverage, a standardized prompt structure is employed. This structure guides the AI in understanding the various facets of the policy request and generating a well-formed document. The general structure includes:

*   **SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:** Sets the persona and primary directive for the AI (e.g.,

    *   **Data Types Handled:** A list of sensitive data types the organization processes (e.g., "Personal Identifiable Information (PII)," "Health Information," "Payment Card Data," "Classified Government Information," "Intellectual Property").
*   **COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORKS AND CONTROLS:** This section is the core of the compliance directive, specifying:
    *   **Primary Framework(s):** The main compliance standards the policy must adhere to (e.g., "ISM," "Essential 8," "ISO 27001," "PSPF," "APRA CPS 234," "Privacy Act 1988").
    *   **Specific Controls/Requirements to Address:** A detailed list of individual controls, clauses, or principles from the specified frameworks. For frameworks with maturity models (like Essential 8), the target maturity level is indicated. For PSPF, relevant policies and guidelines are specified.
    *   **Cross-Framework Mappings (if applicable):** Instructions if the policy needs to demonstrate how it satisfies requirements from multiple frameworks simultaneously, highlighting efficiencies.
*   **POLICY CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:** Guides the AI on the structure and specific elements to include within the policy:
    *   **Key Sections to Include:** A list of mandatory headings and sub-sections (e.g., "Introduction," "Scope," "Definitions," "Roles and Responsibilities," "Policy Statements," "Procedures," "Compliance and Enforcement," "Review and Update," "Related Documents").
    *   **Specific Policy Statements/Directives:** Any particular rules or mandates the policy must enforce.
    *   **Procedural Guidance:** Indication of whether the policy should include high-level procedural steps.
    *   **Reporting Requirements:** Details on incident reporting, compliance reporting, and regulatory notifications.
    *   **Training and Awareness:** Requirements for staff training and awareness programs.
*   **OUTPUT FORMAT AND CONSTRAINTS:** Defines the non-content aspects of the output:
    *   **Format:** The desired output format (e.g., "Markdown with clear, hierarchical headings," "bullet points for key requirements").
    *   **Tone:** The required tone of voice (e.g., "Formal, authoritative," "clear, easy to understand").
    *   **Length:** An approximate word count or length guideline.
    *   **Exclusions/Limitations:** What should *not* be included (e.g., "Do not include specific technical configurations").
    *   **Language:** The language of the output (e.g., "English (Australian context)").
*   **EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Optional):** For fine-tuning or few-shot learning, a good example of a previously generated policy can be provided to guide the AI's style and content.
