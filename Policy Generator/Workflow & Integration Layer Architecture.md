# Workflow & Integration Layer Architecture

The Workflow & Integration Layer serves as the crucial interface between the client's environment, external systems, and the core compliance platform. It is responsible for secure data ingestion, seamless system integration, and robust authentication and authorization, enabling the platform to receive client data, trigger AI workflows, and deliver insights.

## 1. APIs for Client Data Ingestion

Secure and efficient ingestion of client data is fundamental for the AI agents to perform their functions (policy generation, tender writing, compliance monitoring). A set of well-defined APIs will facilitate this process.

**API Design Principles:**

*   **RESTful Architecture:** APIs will adhere to RESTful principles for simplicity, scalability, and widespread compatibility.
*   **Statelessness:** Each request from a client to the server will contain all the information needed to understand the request, promoting scalability.
*   **Resource-Oriented:** APIs will expose resources (e.g., client profiles, system configurations, compliance evidence) that can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **Versioned:** APIs will be versioned (e.g., `/v1/clients`, `/v2/policies`) to allow for backward compatibility and smooth evolution of the platform.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) will be provided to facilitate easy integration for clients and partners.

**Key API Endpoints for Data Ingestion:**

*   **Client Profile Management:**
    *   `POST /clients`: Create a new client profile.
    *   `PUT /clients/{clientId}`: Update an existing client profile.
    *   `GET /clients/{clientId}`: Retrieve client details.
*   **Configuration Data:**
    *   `POST /clients/{clientId}/configurations`: Upload system configuration files (e.g., network diagrams, software inventories).
    *   `PUT /clients/{clientId}/configurations/{configId}`: Update specific configuration data.
*   **Compliance Evidence Upload:**
    *   `POST /clients/{clientId}/evidence`: Upload documents, scan results, audit reports, or other evidence of compliance.
*   **Tender Document Submission:**
    *   `POST /clients/{clientId}/tenders`: Submit tender documents for analysis by the Tender Writer Agent.
*   **Real-time Data Streams (for Compliance Monitoring):**
    *   Potentially use a dedicated streaming API or integrate with event-driven architectures (e.g., AWS Kinesis, Kafka) for continuous ingestion of operational data (logs, security events) for the Compliance Monitor Agent.

**Technology Choice:**

**Amazon API Gateway** will be the primary service for exposing these APIs. It provides:

*   **Scalability:** Handles millions of API calls.
*   **Security:** Integrates with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for protection against common web exploits, and supports various authentication mechanisms.
*   **Throttling and Caching:** Manages traffic and improves performance.
*   **Integration with AWS Lambda:** API Gateway can directly invoke AWS Lambda functions, which will contain the business logic for processing ingested data and triggering N8N workflows.
*   **Monitoring:** Integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring API usage and performance.

For real-time data streams, **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** or **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** could be used to ingest large volumes of streaming data, which can then be processed by Lambda functions and fed into the Compliance Monitor Agent via N8N.



## 2. Connectors for System Integration

Beyond direct API ingestion, the platform will offer various connectors to integrate with common client systems, enabling automated data exchange and reducing manual effort. These connectors will leverage N8N's extensive integration capabilities.

**Types of Connectors:**

*   **Cloud Storage Connectors:** For pulling data from cloud storage providers (e.g., Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint, Dropbox) where clients might store compliance-related documents or system configurations.
*   **IT Service Management (ITSM) Connectors:** To integrate with ITSM platforms (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow) for automated task creation, incident reporting, and change management related to compliance actions.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) / Log Management Connectors:** For ingesting security logs and events from SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk, Elastic Stack) or cloud logging services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor) to feed the Compliance Monitor Agent.
*   **Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Connectors:** To retrieve asset inventory and configuration details from CMDBs for comprehensive compliance assessments.
*   **HR System Connectors:** For integrating with HR systems (e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors) to manage user access, roles, and training records relevant to compliance.
*   **Email/Communication Platform Connectors:** For sending notifications, alerts, and reports to relevant stakeholders (e.g., compliance officers, IT teams) via email or collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

**Technology Choice:**

**N8N** will be the primary tool for building and managing these connectors. Its rich library of pre-built integrations (500+ apps and services) and its ability to connect to custom APIs or databases make it highly flexible. N8N workflows will encapsulate the logic for:

*   **Authentication:** Securely authenticating with external systems using OAuth, API keys, or other methods.
*   **Data Extraction:** Pulling relevant data from connected systems.
*   **Data Transformation:** Mapping and transforming data into a format suitable for the compliance platform.
*   **Error Handling:** Managing connection failures, data parsing errors, and retries.
*   **Scheduling:** Automating data synchronization at predefined intervals.

For custom or highly specialized integrations, **AWS Lambda** functions can be used in conjunction with N8N. Lambda can execute custom code to interact with systems that do not have direct N8N integrations or require complex data processing before ingestion. For example, a Lambda function could be triggered by an N8N workflow to connect to a legacy on-premise system via a secure tunnel (e.g., AWS Site-to-Site VPN or Direct Connect) and extract data.



## 3. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

Robust authentication and authorization are critical to secure access to the compliance platform and its underlying data and functionalities. This layer will implement industry-standard security practices to protect client information and ensure only authorized users and systems can interact with the platform.

**3.1. Authentication (Who are you?)**

Authentication verifies the identity of users and systems attempting to access the platform.

*   **For Client Users (Dashboard & UX Layer):**
    *   **AWS Cognito:** Will be used as the primary identity provider for client users. Cognito provides user directories, sign-up/sign-in flows, and integrates with social identity providers (Google, Facebook) and enterprise identity providers (SAML, OpenID Connect). It supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    *   **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):** Upon successful authentication, Cognito will issue JWTs, which will be used by the frontend (Dashboard & UX Layer) to authenticate requests to the backend APIs (via API Gateway).
*   **For System-to-System Integration (APIs & Connectors):**
    *   **API Keys:** For simpler integrations where a client system needs to push data, API keys can be used, managed and rotated securely.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** For more complex integrations with third-party applications or services, OAuth 2.0 will provide secure delegated access. This is particularly relevant for N8N connectors interacting with external systems.
    *   **AWS IAM Roles:** For internal AWS services (e.g., Lambda functions, N8N running on EC2 or within a container service) interacting with other AWS resources, IAM roles will provide fine-grained permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

**3.2. Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)**

Authorization determines what authenticated users and systems are permitted to do within the platform.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The platform will implement RBAC to manage user permissions. Roles (e.g., Client Admin, Compliance Officer, Read-Only User) will be defined, and each role will have specific permissions to access certain features, data, or perform specific actions.
    *   **AWS Cognito User Pools & Identity Pools:** Cognito can manage user groups and roles, which can then be mapped to IAM roles for fine-grained access control to AWS resources.
*   **Policy-Based Authorization:** For more dynamic or granular access control, policies can be defined that evaluate attributes of the user, the resource, and the environment (e.g., a user can only view policies for their own organization).
    *   **AWS IAM Policies:** Will be extensively used to define permissions for accessing AWS resources (S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints). These policies will be attached to IAM roles assumed by users or services.
*   **API Gateway Authorization:** API Gateway will enforce authorization policies before requests reach the backend services. This can include:
    *   **Cognito User Pool Authorizers:** To validate JWTs issued by Cognito.
    *   **Lambda Authorizers (Custom Authorizers):** For custom authorization logic, allowing for complex policy evaluations.
    *   **IAM Authorizers:** For authenticating and authorizing requests using AWS IAM credentials.

**Security Best Practices:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and systems.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit access logs (via AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch) to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Secure Credential Management:** Store and manage API keys and other credentials securely, using services like AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **Encryption:** All authentication and authorization data will be encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest.

By combining these authentication and authorization mechanisms, the Workflow & Integration Layer will provide a secure and controlled environment for all interactions with the compliance automation platform.
