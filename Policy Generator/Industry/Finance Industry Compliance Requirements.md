# Australian Finance Industry Compliance Requirements

The Australian finance industry is subject to a stringent regulatory environment, with a strong emphasis on information security and operational resilience. In addition to the general cybersecurity frameworks like ISM, Essential 8, and ISO 27001, financial institutions regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) must comply with **Prudential Standard CPS 234 Information Security**.

## Key Compliance Frameworks and Standards:

1.  **APRA CPS 234 Information Security:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is a mandatory prudential standard for all APRA-regulated entities (e.g., banks, insurers, superannuation funds). It aims to ensure that these entities maintain information security capabilities commensurate with their information security vulnerabilities and threats. The ultimate goal is to protect information assets and maintain operational resilience.
    *   **Key Requirements:** CPS 234 covers various aspects, including:
        *   **Information Security Policy Framework:** Entities must maintain an information security policy framework commensurate with their exposures to vulnerabilities and threats.
        *   **Information Asset Identification and Classification:** Identification and classification of information assets based on criticality and sensitivity.
        *   **Information Security Capabilities:** Maintenance of information security capabilities to protect information assets and respond to incidents.
        *   **Incident Management:** Robust incident management processes, including reporting to APRA.
        *   **Testing:** Regular testing of information security controls.
        *   **Third-Party Arrangements:** Management of information security risks associated with third-party service providers.
    *   **Relationship with other frameworks:** CPS 234 is often compared with ISO 27001. While ISO 27001 is a general information security management system standard, CPS 234 is specifically tailored for the Australian financial sector. There are significant overlaps, and implementing ISO 27001 can greatly assist in meeting CPS 234 requirements, but it does not equate to full compliance.

2.  **ISM (Information Security Manual):**
    *   **Relevance:** While primarily for Australian Government entities, the ISM's detailed cybersecurity controls and risk management approach are highly influential and often adopted or referenced by critical infrastructure sectors, including finance, to enhance their security posture. It provides a comprehensive set of controls that can be mapped to broader information security requirements.

3.  **Essential Eight:**
    *   **Relevance:** The Essential Eight mitigation strategies are a baseline set of controls recommended by the ACSC to protect against common cyber threats. Financial institutions often implement these strategies as a fundamental part of their cybersecurity hygiene, complementing the more extensive requirements of CPS 234 and ISO 27001.

4.  **ISO 27001:**
    *   **Relevance:** ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). Many Australian financial institutions pursue ISO 27001 certification to demonstrate a robust and systematic approach to managing information security risks. It provides a framework for policies and procedures that include legal, physical, and technical controls, which can help in meeting the broader objectives of CPS 234.

5.  **PSPF (Protective Security Policy Framework):**
    *   **Relevance:** PSPF is mandatory for Australian Government entities. For financial institutions, its direct applicability is limited unless they are acting as a vendor or service provider to the Australian Government and handling government information. In such cases, compliance with relevant PSPF requirements would be a contractual obligation.

## Overlaps and Synergies:

There are significant overlaps between these frameworks. For instance, many controls in ISO 27001 and ISM directly support the objectives of CPS 234. The Essential Eight provides a practical set of technical controls that can contribute to achieving compliance with all three. A comprehensive information security program in the Australian finance industry would typically integrate elements from all these standards, with CPS 234 serving as the primary regulatory driver for APRA-regulated entities.

## Controls for Policy Generation:

When generating policies for the Australian finance industry, the AI engine must consider:

*   **APRA CPS 234 specific clauses:** Policies must directly address the requirements outlined in CPS 234, such as information asset classification, incident response, and third-party risk management.
*   **ISM controls:** Incorporate relevant ISM controls for detailed technical and procedural security measures.
*   **Essential Eight strategies:** Ensure policies reflect the implementation of the Essential Eight, particularly for baseline cyber hygiene.
*   **ISO 27001 Annex A controls:** Leverage the comprehensive set of controls from ISO 27001 to build a holistic ISMS.
*   **Industry-specific context:** Policies should be tailored to the unique operational context, risk appetite, and business model of the financial institution.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Landscape:** Reference relevant Australian laws and regulations pertaining to data privacy (e.g., Privacy Act 1988), financial services, and cybersecurity.
