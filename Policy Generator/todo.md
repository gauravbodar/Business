## To-Do List

### Phase 1: Develop & Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Step-by-step instructions for setting up the backend (API orchestration, AI model integration, database design for policies/tenders/compliance dashboards).
- [x] Frontend setup (React/Lovable.dev → Replit or Vercel for hosting).
- [x] Authentication and membership management (Stripe/PayPal).
- [x] Recommended stack and deployment strategy (MVP speed > heavy infra).

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation
- [x] Policy Generation Engine: how to structure prompts, store outputs, and provide export options (Word, PDF).
- [x] Tender Auto-Writing: workflow for gathering tender requirements, generating draft responses, and enabling user edits.
- [x] Compliance Dashboard: data model + UI to track compliance status, upload evidence, and map against frameworks.
- [x] Technical details: API endpoints, n8n workflows (if applicable), storage schema.

### Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (n8n or equivalent)
- [x] Where to use n8n for automation: Generating and storing policy drafts, Sending alerts/emails when tenders are updated, Compliance dashboard reminders.
- [x] Node-by-node operational design (trigger, AI call, data cleaner, storage, notifications).

### Phase 4: Membership & SaaS Layer
- [x] Technical guide for subscription plans: Free tier, Paid tier, Enterprise.

### Phase 6: Compliance & Risk
- [x] Operational compliance: handling of client data (Privacy Act 1988, ISO 27001 basics).
- [x] Clear disclaimers: "AI-generated policies require legal review".
- [x] Data retention and audit logging for generated documents.

### Phase 7: Execution Timeline
- [x] Convert architecture → execution plan.
- [x] 7-day sprint plan to get MVP policy generator live with payments enabled.
- [x] 30-day roadmap: tender-writing feature.
- [x] 90-day roadmap: compliance dashboard + enterprise pilot.

### Phase 8: Compile Final Operational Document
- [x] Output as structured sections with checklists and SOPs.
- [x] Include example API routes, n8n JSON skeletons, and DB schema outlines.
- [x] Role tags for each step: [Dev], [Ops], [Growth], [Founder].
