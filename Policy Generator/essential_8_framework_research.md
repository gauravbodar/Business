# Essential Eight Framework Research Findings

The Essential Eight is a set of eight baseline mitigation strategies developed by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) to help organizations protect against cyber threats. It is designed to improve an organization's cybersecurity posture and reduce its attack surface.

Key aspects of the Essential Eight framework:

*   **Eight Mitigation Strategies:** The framework comprises eight key mitigation strategies:
    1.  Patch applications
    2.  Patch operating systems
    3.  Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    4.  Restrict administrative privileges
    5.  Harden user applications
    6.  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings
    7.  Application whitelisting
    8.  Daily backups
*   **Maturity Levels:** The Essential Eight defines four maturity levels (Maturity Level Zero through to Maturity Level Three), allowing organizations to assess and improve their cyber security measures against common threats.
*   **Purpose:** The underlying intent is to ensure IT hygiene, reduce the attack surface, and build a stronger security posture.
*   **Focus:** It offers a streamlined and focused framework for addressing common cybersecurity threats, particularly relevant for businesses in Australia.
*   **Operationalization:** There are resources and guides available on how to operationalize the Essential Eight framework, including checklists and implementation steps.
*   **AWS Support:** AWS provides guidance and case studies to help organizations reach maturity level three for the Essential Eight framework within their AWS environments.

While often discussed alongside the ISM, the Essential Eight focuses on practical, actionable controls to mitigate specific cyber threats.
