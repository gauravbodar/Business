# PSPF Framework Research Findings

The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) is a mandatory policy framework for Australian Government entities. It prescribes what these entities must do to protect their people, information, and resources, both domestically and overseas. The PSPF aims to achieve a mature security culture and practices across the Australian Government.

Key aspects of the PSPF framework:

*   **Mandatory for Australian Government Entities:** The PSPF is a set of mandatory requirements for non-corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). It represents better practice for corporate Commonwealth entities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies.
*   **Four Pillars of Security:** The PSPF is structured around four key elements of protective security:
    1.  **Security Governance:** Establishing a security culture and managing security risks.
    2.  **Information Security:** Protecting official information from compromise.
    3.  **Personnel Security:** Ensuring that Australian Government personnel are suitable to access resources.
    4.  **Physical Security:** Protecting Australian Government assets from compromise.
*   **Risk-Based Approach:** While mandatory, the PSPF encourages entities to apply a risk-based approach to protective security, allowing them to tailor security measures to their specific risk environment.
*   **Policy Requirements and Guidelines:** The PSPF consists of core policy requirements that entities *must* implement, supported by guidelines that provide best practice advice on how to implement these requirements.
*   **Continuous Updates:** The PSPF is regularly updated (e.g., PSPF 2024, PSPF 2025) to address evolving security threats and best practices, including recent mandates for Zero Trust principles and enhanced Insider Risk Management.
*   **Compliance Benefits:** PSPF compliance brings significant advantages, including enhanced national security, greater trust from stakeholders, and access to additional government opportunities.
*   **Integration with other frameworks:** While distinct, PSPF requirements often overlap with other security frameworks like the ISM and Essential Eight, particularly in areas of information security and cybersecurity.

For vendors working with the Australian Government, understanding and demonstrating compliance with the PSPF is crucial for tender submissions and ongoing contractual obligations. The framework provides a comprehensive guide for safeguarding sensitive government information, personnel, and assets.
