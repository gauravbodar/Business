# ISM Framework Research Findings

The Information Security Manual (ISM) is a cybersecurity framework developed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). Its primary purpose is to outline a cybersecurity framework that organizations can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their information technology and operational technology (OT) systems from cyber threats.

Key characteristics and aspects of the ISM:

*   **Principles-based:** It provides detailed guidelines and best practices for securing information and systems.
*   **Risk-based:** The ISM is fundamentally risk-based, meaning it does not enforce mandatory compliance but rather guides organizations in managing their cybersecurity risks.
*   **Scope:** It covers a wide range of cybersecurity controls designed to protect information and systems.
*   **Components:** Key components often include risk assessment, control implementation, and continuous monitoring.
*   **Integration:** It is often discussed in conjunction with other Australian cybersecurity frameworks, such as the Essential Eight.
*   **AWS Support:** AWS Audit Manager provides a prebuilt standard framework that supports the ACSC ISM, indicating its adoption and relevance in cloud environments.

The ISM helps organizations establish a conceptual structure for managing and supporting information security, ensuring compliance and protection against various cyber threats.
