## CASA Regulations and Insurance for Commercial Drone Operations in Australia

This section outlines the key regulatory and insurance requirements for commercial drone operations in Australia, as mandated by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).

### Drone Registration

-   **Mandatory Registration**: Any drone used for business purposes or as part of a job, regardless of its weight, **must be registered with CASA**. Flying an unregistered drone for commercial purposes is an offense.

-   **Process**: Registration can be completed through the myCASA portal and typically takes a few minutes. (Source: [CASA Register Your Drone](https://www.casa.gov.au/drones/drone-registration/register-your-drone))

### Operational Permissions and Commercial Operation Requirements

CASA distinguishes between different types of commercial drone operations, primarily based on the drone's weight and the nature of the operation.

-   **Excluded Category (Sub-2kg Drones)**:
    -   If operating a drone weighing **2 kg or less** for commercial purposes, and it's not flown in a way that requires an RPA Operator's Certificate (ReOC), you may operate under the 'excluded category'. This typically requires an **Operator Accreditation**. (Source: [Dronedeploy](https://help.dronedeploy.com/hc/en-us/articles/19739227685527-Drone-regulations-in-Australia))
    -   This accreditation involves completing an online course and passing a test. It allows for certain commercial operations without a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) or ReOC, provided specific standard operating conditions are met.

-   **Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and RPA Operator's Certificate (ReOC)**:
    -   For operations that fall outside the excluded category (e.g., flying drones over 2 kg, flying outside standard operating conditions, or operating with multiple drones), a **Remote Pilot Licence (RePL)** is generally required for the pilot, and an **RPA Operator's Certificate (ReOC)** is required for the business or individual conducting the operations. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules](https://skymediatraining.com.au/casa-drone-rules-repl-certification/))
    -   An RePL is obtained through CASA-approved training organizations. An ReOC is issued to an organization or individual to conduct commercial RPA operations. Eligibility for an RePL typically requires being at least 16 years old. (Source: [ABLIS Drone Registration](https://ablis.business.gov.au/service/ag/drone-registration/41795))

### General Flight Rules (Applicable to all operations unless specifically authorized)

-   **Height Limit**: Drones must not fly higher than **120 meters (400 feet)** above ground level. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules](https://www.casa.gov.au/knowyourdrone/drone-rules), [CASA Drone Rules: RePL Certification](https://skymediatraining.com.au/casa-drone-rules-repl-certification/))
-   **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)**: The drone must be kept within the pilot's visual line of sight at all times. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules: RePL Certification](https://skymediatraining.com.au/casa-drone-rules-repl-certification/), [UAV Coach](https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-in-australia/))
-   **Distance from People**: Drones must be flown at least **30 meters away from people** who are not directly associated with the operation. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules](https://www.casa.gov.au/knowyourdrone/drone-rules))
-   **Overhead People**: Drones must **not fly over people** at any height. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules](https://www.casa.gov.au/knowyourdrone/drone-rules))
-   **Daylight Operations**: Drones must only be flown during the day. Specific permissions are required for night operations, which typically necessitate an ReOC.

-   **Restricted Airspace**: Avoid flying in restricted areas, near airports, or in areas where drone flights are prohibited (e.g., national parks, certain government buildings). Use a CASA-verified safety app to identify no-fly zones. (Source: [CASA Drones](https://www.casa.gov.au/drones), [Drones.gov.au](https://www.drones.gov.au/drone-rules/state-and-territory-rules))
-   **Privacy**: While CASA regulates safety, state and territory laws may cover privacy. Operators should be mindful of privacy concerns when flying. (Source: [CASA Drone Rules](https://www.casa.gov.au/knowyourdrone/drone-rules))

### Insurance for Commercial Drone Operations

-   **Public Liability Insurance**: While not explicitly mandated by CASA for all operations, **public liability insurance is highly recommended and often a requirement for commercial work**. It protects against claims for property damage or personal injury caused by the drone. Many clients will require proof of insurance before engaging drone services.
-   **Drone-Specific Insurance**: Specialized drone insurance policies are available that can cover hull damage (damage to the drone itself), third-party liability, and equipment. It is advisable to seek quotes from local Australian insurers.

**Recommendation**: For commercial drone videography, especially when offering paid services, obtaining comprehensive public liability insurance is crucial. It is advisable to consult with Australian insurance providers specializing in aviation or drone operations to ensure adequate coverage.
