### 8. Bank/Receiver Sale Pages:

Direct, publicly accessible pages on major Australian bank websites listing mortgagee or receiver sales are not readily apparent from initial research. Banks appear to primarily use real estate agents and auction houses to market and sell these properties. Therefore, the most effective way to find these listings is through the real estate portals and auction calendars already identified, using specific keywords.

### 9. Real-Estate Portals (with keyword search):

Major real estate portals are a primary channel for all types of distressed property sales, including those from banks, receivers, and private sellers. The key is to use specific keywords in the search.

*   **realestate.com.au:** (https://www.realestate.com.au/) - Search with keywords like "mortgagee in possession", "urgent sale", "must sell", "deceased estate", "divorce", "forced sale".
*   **domain.com.au:** (https://www.domain.com.au/) - Similar keyword search strategy as realestate.com.au.
