## 5. Compliance & Risk Checklist

Developing a product that automatically discovers distressed properties requires careful consideration of legal and ethical implications, particularly concerning data privacy, web scraping, and property-related regulations in Australia. This checklist outlines key areas to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.

### 5.1. Australian Privacy Laws (Privacy Act 1988 (Cth))

*   **Personal Information:**
    *   **Identify Personal Information:** Clearly define what constitutes "personal information" within the collected data (e.g., names of individuals in probate notices, contact details of agents/liquidators). [1]
    *   **Purpose Limitation:** Ensure that any collected personal information is used solely for the purpose of identifying distressed property leads and delivering verified research leads, as stated in the product goal. Avoid secondary uses without explicit consent or legal basis. [1]
    *   **Collection Methods:** If personal information is collected, ensure it is done by lawful and fair means. Publicly available information is generally permissible, but the *manner* of collection (e.g., aggressive scraping) can be an issue. [1]
    *   **Storage and Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect any stored personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. [4]
    *   **Access and Correction:** Provide mechanisms for individuals to access and correct their personal information if it is held by the system.
    *   **Retention:** Establish clear data retention policies for personal information, ensuring it is not kept longer than necessary. [5]
*   **Anonymization/De-identification:** Where possible and not detrimental to the product's core function, anonymize or de-identify personal information to reduce privacy risks.

### 5.2. Data Scraping Rules and Ethics

*   **Terms of Service (ToS):** Review the Terms of Service of each website being scraped. Violating ToS can lead to legal action (e.g., breach of contract) and IP blocking. [2]
*   **Robots.txt:** Respect `robots.txt` directives on websites, which indicate areas that web crawlers should not access. While not legally binding, it's an ethical standard. [2]
*   **Website Load:** Implement rate limiting and delays in scraping processes to avoid overloading target websites. Excessive requests can be seen as a denial-of-service attack. [2]
*   **Copyright:** Be mindful of copyright laws. While factual data generally isn't copyrightable, the *presentation* or *compilation* of data can be. Ensure that the way data is extracted and presented does not infringe on intellectual property rights. [3]
*   **Misleading Conduct (Australian Consumer Law - ACL):** If scraped data is used for marketing or advertising, ensure it is accurate and not misleading, to comply with the ACL. [2]
*   **Public vs. Private Data:** Focus on publicly available data. Scraping data from behind login walls or private sections of websites without authorization is generally illegal and unethical.

### 5.3. Conveyancing Regulations

*   **Information Accuracy:** The product provides leads, not legal advice. Clearly disclaim that all information should be independently verified by a qualified legal professional (conveyancer or solicitor) before any action is taken. Property details, ownership, and legal status can be complex and require expert verification.
*   **Source Verification:** Emphasize that the data collected is from public notices and listings, and its accuracy depends on the original source. The product should facilitate, not replace, due diligence.
*   **No Legal Advice:** The product should explicitly state that it does not offer legal, financial, or property advice. Its role is purely as an information aggregation and lead generation tool.

### 5.4. Sources Requiring Paid Licenses or Subscriptions

Several identified sources require payment for access, which will impact the cost-effectiveness and scalability of the product if relied upon heavily.

*   **SQM Research Distressed Properties Report:** Requires a paid subscription for access to their aggregated distressed property listings. [Source 1.1]
*   **Real Estate Investar:** Likely requires a paid subscription for full access to their analysis and listings, beyond free resources. [Source 1.2]
*   **Supreme Court of Victoria - RedCrest-Probate:** Requires creating an account and payment for each search of granted applications. [Source 2.3]
*   **Real Estate Deals Australia (REDA):** Offers a 30-day free trial, but then requires a subscription for continued access to their aggregated bank-owned and foreclosed property listings. [Source 5.1]

To keep costs low as per the constraint, the MVP should prioritize free and publicly accessible data sources, and paid sources should be considered for premium features or later stages of product development. The AFSA Bankruptcy Register, with its API potential, is a notable exception as a public source with structured access. [Source 3.1]
